    It’s Kreon. The way he’s treated our brothers. <br>
  Hasn’t he buried one with honor?<br>
  But he’s shamed the other. <br>
  Discraced him!<br>
  Eteokles, they say, was laid to rest <br>
  according to law and custom. <br>
  The dead will respect him in Hades. <br>
  Byt Polyneikes’ sorry body can’t be touched. <br>
  <br>
  The city is forbidden to mourn him or bury him <br>
  –no tomb, no tears
