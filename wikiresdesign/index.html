<p><div id="bio">Richard Buckminster Fuller (/ˈfʊlər/; July 12, 1895 – July 1, 1983)
  [1] was an American architect,<br> systems theorist, author, designer, inventor, and futurist.
  He styled his name as R. Buckminster <br>Fuller in his writings, publishing more than 30 books and coining
   or popularizing <br>such terms as "Spaceship Earth", "Dymaxion" (e.g., Dymaxion house,<br> Dymaxion car,
   Dymaxion map), "ephemeralization", "synergetics", <br> and "tensegrity".
Fuller developed numerous inventions, mainly <br> architectural designs, and popularized the
widely known <br>geodesic dome; carbon molecules known  as<br> fullerenes were later named by scientists
 for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres. He also served as the second
 World President of Mensa International from 1974 to 1983.[2][3]</p></div>

 <h3>Life and work</h3>
 <p>
 Fuller was born on July 12, 1895, in Milton, Massachusetts, the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and
 Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and grand-nephew of Margaret Fuller, an American journalist, critic, and
 women's rights advocate associated with the American transcendentalism movement. The unusual middle name,
 Buckminster, was an ancestral family name. As a child, Richard Buckminster Fuller tried numerous variations
  of his name. He used to sign his name differently each year in the guest register of his family summer
  vacation home at Bear Island, Maine. He finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller.[4]
<br>
Fuller spent much of his youth on Bear Island, in Penobscot Bay off the coast of Maine.
He attended Froebelian Kindergarten.[5] He disagreed with the way geometry was taught in school,
being unable to experience for himself that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented an "empty"
mathematical point, or that a line could stretch off to infinity. To him these were illogical, and
led to his work on synergetics. He often made items from materials he found in the woods, and sometimes
made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats.
By age 12, he had invented a 'push pull' system for propelling a rowboat by use of an inverted umbrella
connected to the transom with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat
toward its destination. Later in life, Fuller took exception to the term "invention".
<br>
Years later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design,
 but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would
  require. Fuller earned a machinist's certification, and knew how to use the press brake, stretch press,
  and other tools and equipment used in the sheet metal trade.[6]
<br></p>
<h4>Education</h4>
<p>Fuller attended Milton Academy in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at Harvard College,
  where he was affiliated with Adams House. He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all
  his money partying with a vaudeville troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his
  "irresponsibility and lack of interest". By his own appraisal, he was a non-conforming misfit in the
  fraternity environment.[6]</p>
  <h4>Wartime experience</h4>
  <p>Between his sessions at Harvard, Fuller worked in Canada as a mechanic in a textile mill, and later as
    a laborer in the meat-packing industry. He also served in the U.S. Navy in World War I, as a shipboard
    radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as commander of the crash rescue boat USS Inca.
     After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience.
      In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the
      Stockade Building System for producing light-weight, weatherproof, and fireproof housing—although
      the company would ultimately fail[6] in 1927.[7]</p>
<h4>Depression and epiphany</h4>
<p>Buckminster Fuller recalled 1927 as a pivotal year of his life. His daughter Alexandra had died in 1922 of complications from polio and spinal meningitis[8] just before her fourth birthday.[9] Stanford historian, Barry Katz, found signs that around this time in his life Fuller was suffering from depression and anxiety.[10] Fuller dwelled on his daughter's death, suspecting that it was connected with the Fullers' damp and drafty living conditions.[9] This provided motivation for Fuller's involvement in Stockade Building Systems, a business which aimed to provide affordable, efficient housing.[9]

In 1927, at age 32, Fuller lost his job as president of Stockade. The Fuller family had no savings,
and the birth of their daughter Allegra in 1927 added to the financial challenges. Fuller drank heavily
 and reflected upon the solution to his family's struggles on long walks around Chicago. During the autumn
  of 1927, Fuller contemplated suicide by drowning in Lake Michigan, so that his family could benefit from
  a life insurance payment.[11]
<br>
Fuller said that he had experienced a profound incident which would provide direction and purpose for his
life. He felt as though he was suspended several feet above the ground enclosed in a white sphere of light.
A voice spoke directly to Fuller, and declared:</p>
<blockquote>
  From now on you need never await temporal attestation to your thought. You think the truth.
  You do not have the right to eliminate yourself. You do not belong to you. You belong to the Universe.
  Your significance will remain forever obscure to you, but you may assume that you are fulfilling your
  role if you apply yourself to converting your experiences to the highest advantage of others.[12]
</blockquote>
<p>Fuller stated that this experience led to a profound re-examination of his life.
  He ultimately chose to embark on "an experiment, to find what a single individual could contribute to
  changing the world and benefiting all humanity".[13]
<br>
Speaking to audiences later in life, Fuller would regularly recount the story of his Lake Michigan experience,
 and its transformative impact on his life.[9] Historians have been unable to identify direct evidence for
 this experience within the 1927 papers of Fuller's Chronofile archives, housed at Stanford University.
  Stanford historian Barry Katz suggests that the suicide story may be a myth which Fuller constructed
  later in life, to summarize this formative period of his career.[14]</p>
  <h4>Recovery</h4>
  <p>In 1927 Fuller resolved to think independently which included a commitment to
    "the search for the principles governing the universe and help advance the evolution of humanity
     in accordance with them ... finding ways of doing more with less to the end that all people everywhere
      can have more and more".[citation needed] By 1928, Fuller was living in Greenwich Village and
      spending much of his time at the popular café Romany Marie's,[15] where he had spent an evening in
       conversation with Marie and Eugene O'Neill several years earlier.[16] Fuller accepted a job
       decorating the interior of the café in exchange for meals,[15] giving informal lectures several
       times a week,[16][17] and models of the Dymaxion house were exhibited at the café.
       Isamu Noguchi arrived during 1929—Constantin Brâncuși, an old friend of Marie's,[18]
       had directed him there[15]—and Noguchi and Fuller were soon collaborating on several projects,
       [17][19] including the modeling of the Dymaxion car based on recent work by Aurel Persu.[20]
       It was the beginning of their lifelong friendship.</p>
    <h4>Geodesic domes</h4>
    <p>Fuller taught at Black Mountain College in North Carolina during the summers of 1948 and 1949,[21]
       serving as its Summer Institute director in 1949. Fuller had been shy and withdrawn,
       but he was persuaded to participate in a theatrical performance of Erik Satie's Le piège de
        Méduse produced by John Cage, who was also teaching at Black Mountain. During rehearsals,
        under the tutelage of Arthur Penn, then a student at Black Mountain, Fuller broke through
        his inhibitions to become confident as a performer and speaker.[22]
<br>
At Black Mountain, with the support of a group of professors and students,
 he began reinventing a project that would make him famous: the geodesic dome.
 Although the geodesic dome had been created, built and awarded a German patent on June 19, 1925 by
 Dr. Walther Bauersfeld, Fuller was awarded United States patents. Fuller neglected to cite that the
 self supporting dome had already been built some 26 years prior in his patent applications. Although
 Fuller undoubtedly popularized this type of structure he is mistakenly given credit for its design.
<br>
One of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at Bennington College in Vermont, where he lectured
often. Although Bauersfeild's dome could support a full skin of concrete it was not until 1949 that Fuller
erected a geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits.
It was 4.3 meters (14 feet) in diameter and constructed of aluminium aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic
skin, in the form of an icosahedron. To prove his design, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework
several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of this work,
 and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the Marines.
 Within a few years, there were thousands of such domes around the world.
<br>
Fuller's first "continuous tension – discontinuous compression" geodesic dome (full sphere in this case)
was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students.[23]
These continuous tension – discontinuous compression structures featured single force compression members
(no flexure or bending moments) that did not touch each other and were 'suspended' by the tensional members.</p>
<h4>Dymaxion Chronofile</h4>
<p>For half of a century, Fuller developed many ideas, designs and inventions,
  particularly regarding practical, inexpensive shelter and transportation.
   He documented his life, philosophy and ideas scrupulously by a daily diary
   (later called the Dymaxion Chronofile), and by twenty-eight publications.
    Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes
    augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the Dymaxion car project.</p>
<h4>World stage</h4>
<p>International recognition began with the success of huge geodesic domes during the 1950s.
  Fuller lectured at North Carolina State University in Raleigh in 1949, where he met James Fitzgibbon,
   who would become a close friend and colleague. Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics,
   Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect and
   engineer for both companies. Richard Lewontin, a new faculty member in population genetics at North
   Carolina State University, provided Fuller with computer calculations for the lengths of the domes'
    edges.[24]<br>

Fuller began working with architect Shoji Sadao[25] in 1954, and in 1964 they co-founded the architectural
firm Fuller & Sadao Inc., whose first project was to design the large geodesic dome for the U.S.
Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal.[25] This building is now the "Montreal Biosphère". In 1962,
the artist and searcher John McHale wrote the first monograph on Fuller, published by George Braziller
in New York.<br>

After employing several Southern Illinois University Carbondale graduate students to rebuild his models
 following an apartment fire in the summer of 1959, Fuller was recruited by longtime friend Harold Cohen
  to serve as a research professor of "design science exploration" at the institution's School of Art
  and Design. According to SIU architecture professor Jon Davey, the position was
  "unlike most faculty appointments [...] more a celebrity role than a teaching job" in which Fuller
  offered few courses and was only stipulated to spend two months per year on campus.[26] Nevertheless,
   his time in Carbondale was "extremely productive," and Fuller was promoted to university professor in
   1968 and distinguished university professor in 1972.[27][28]<br>

Working as a designer, scientist, developer, and writer, he continued to lecture for many years around
the world. He collaborated at SIU with John McHale. In 1965, they inaugurated the World Design Science
Decade (1965 to 1975) at the meeting of the International Union of Architects in Paris, which was, in
Fuller's own words, devoted to "applying the principles of science to solving the problems of humanity."<br>

From 1972 until retiring as university professor emeritus in 1975, Fuller held a joint appointment at
Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, where he had designed the dome for the campus Religious
Center in 1971.[29] During this period, he also held a joint fellowship at a consortium of
 Philadelphia-area institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania, Bryn Mawr College,
  Haverford College, Swarthmore College and the University City Science Center; as a result of
   this affiliation, the University of Pennsylvania appointed him university professor emeritus
   in 1975.[30]<br>

Fuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy,
such as solar- and wind-derived electricity. He hoped for an age of "omni-successful education
and sustenance of all humanity". Fuller referred to himself as "the property of universe" and
 during one radio interview he gave later in life, declared himself and his work
  "the property of all humanity". For his lifetime of work, the American Humanist Association
  named him the 1969 Humanist of the Year.<br>

In 1976, Fuller was a key participant at UN Habitat I, the first UN forum on human settlements.</p>
<h4>Honors</h4>
<p>Fuller was awarded 28 United States patents[31] and many honorary doctorates.
  In 1960, he was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal from The Franklin Institute. Fuller was
  elected as an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1967, on the occasion of the 50th year
  reunion of his Harvard class of 1917 (from which he was expelled in his first year).[32][33]
  He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968.[34] In 1968, he
  was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full
  Academician in 1970. In 1970, he received the Gold Medal award from the American Institute of
  Architects. In 1976, he received the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University
  Library Associates.[35][36] In 1977, Fuller received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy
  of Achievement.[37] He also received numerous other awards, including the Presidential Medal of
   Freedom presented to him on February 23, 1983, by President Ronald Reagan.</p>
   <h4>Last filmed appearance</h4>
   <p>Fuller's last filmed interview took place on June 21, 1983, in which he spoke at Norman Foster's
     Royal Gold Medal for architecture ceremony.[38] His speech can be watched in the archives of the
      AA School of Architecture, in which he spoke after Sir Robert Sainsbury's introductory speech
      and Foster's keynote address.</p>
      <h4>Death</h4>
      <p>In the year of his death, Fuller described himself as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Guinea Pig B:
I AM NOW CLOSE TO 88 and I am confident that the only thing important about me is that I am an average healthy human. I am also a living case history of a thoroughly documented, half-century, search-and-research project designed to discover what, if anything, an unknown, moneyless individual, with a dependent wife and newborn child, might be able to do effectively on behalf of all humanity that could not be accomplished by great nations, great religions or private enterprise, no matter how rich or powerfully armed.[39]
      </blockquote>
      <p>Fuller died on July 1, 1983, 11 days before his 88th birthday.
        During the period leading up to his death, his wife had been lying comatose in a
        Los Angeles hospital, dying of cancer. It was while visiting her there that he exclaimed,
        at a certain point: "She is squeezing my hand!" He then stood up, suffered a heart attack,
        and died an hour later, at age 87. His wife of 66 years died 36 hours later. They are buried
        in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
  <h3>Philosophy and worldview</h3>
  <p>Buckminster Fuller was a Unitarian, like his grandfather Arthur Buckminster Fuller,[40][41]
    a Unitarian minister. Fuller was also an early environmental activist, aware of the Earth's finite
    resources, and promoted a principle he termed "ephemeralization", which, according to futurist and
    Fuller disciple Stewart Brand, was defined as "doing more with less".[42] Resources and waste from
    crude, inefficient products could be recycled into making more valuable products, thus increasing the
    efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also coined the word synergetics, a catch-all term used
    broadly for communicating experiences using geometric concepts, and more specifically, the empirical
     study of systems in transformation; his focus was on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior
      of any isolated components.<br>

Fuller was a pioneer in thinking globally, and explored energy and material efficiency in the fields
of architecture, engineering and design.[43][44] Citing François de Chardenèdes' opinion that petroleum,
 from the standpoint of its replacement cost in our current energy "budget" (essentially,
 the net incoming solar flux), had cost nature "over a million dollars" per U.S. gallon (US$300,000 per
 litre) to produce. From this point of view, its use as a transportation fuel by people commuting to work
 represents a huge net loss compared to their actual earnings.[45] An encapsulation quotation of his views
 might best be summed up as: "There is no energy crisis, only a crisis of ignorance."[46][47][48]<br>

Though Fuller was concerned about sustainability and human survival under the existing socio-economic
system, he remained optimistic about humanity's future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the
"technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life," his
analysis of the condition of "Spaceship Earth" caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the
1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant
knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted
from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities had become unnecessary.
 Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy. He declared: "selfishness is unnecessary and
 hence-forth unrationalizable ... War is obsolete."[49] He criticized previous utopian schemes as too
 exclusive, and thought this was a major source of their failure. To work, he thought that a utopia
 needed to include everyone.[50]<br>

Fuller was influenced by Alfred Korzybski's idea of general semantics. In the 1950s, Fuller attended
seminars and workshops organized by the Institute of General Semantics, and he delivered the annual Alfred
Korzybski Memorial Lecture in 1955.[51] Korzybski is mentioned in the Introduction of his book Synergetics.
 The two shared a remarkable amount of similarity in their formulations of general semantics.[52]<br>

In his 1970 book I Seem To Be a Verb, he wrote: "I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am.
I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an
integral function of the universe."<br>

Fuller wrote that the natural analytic geometry of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra.
He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or
tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest
possible homogeneous truss is cyclically tetrahedral.[53]<br>

He had become a guru of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as Drop City,
the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 "Dymaxion Award" for "poetically
 economic" domed living structures.</p><br>
 <h2>Major design projects</h3>
 <h4>The geodesic dome</h4>
 <p>Fuller was most famous for his lattice shell structures – geodesic domes, which have been used as
   parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition
   attractions. An examination of the geodesic design by Walther Bauersfeld for the Zeiss-Planetarium,
    built some 28 years prior to Fuller's work, reveals that Fuller's Geodesic Dome patent (U.S. 2,682,235;
     awarded in 1954) is the same design as Bauersfeld's.[54]<br>

Their construction is based on extending some basic principles to build simple "tensegrity" structures
 (tetrahedron, octahedron, and the closest packing of spheres), making them lightweight and stable.
  The geodesic dome was a result of Fuller's exploration of nature's constructing principles to find
  design solutions. The Fuller Dome is referenced in the Hugo Award-winning novel Stand on Zanzibar by
  John Brunner, in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of Manhattan, and it floats
   on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its
   construction of lightweight materials).[55]<br>
   <h4>Transportation</h4>
   <h5>Main article: Dymaxion car</h5>
   <p>The Dymaxion car was a vehicle designed by Fuller, featured prominently at Chicago's 1933-1934
     Century of Progress World's Fair.[58] During the Great Depression, Fuller formed the Dymaxion
      Corporation and built three prototypes with noted naval architect Starling Burgess and a team of
      27 workmen — using donated money as well as a family inheritance.[59][60]<br>

Fuller associated the word Dymaxion with much of his work, a portmanteau of the words dynamic,
maximum, and tension[61] to sum up the goal of his study, "maximum gain of advantage from minimal
 energy input".[62]<br>

The Dymaxion was not an automobile per se, but rather the 'ground-taxying mode' of a vehicle that might
 one day be designed to fly, land and drive — an "Omni-Medium Transport" for air, land and water.[63]
 Fuller focused on the landing and taxiing qualities, and noted severe limitations in its handling.
  The team made constant improvements and refinements to the platform,[56] and Fuller noted the Dymaxion
  "was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable
  improvements".[56]<br>

The bodywork was aerodynamically designed for increased fuel efficiency and speed as well as light weight,
 and its platform featured a lightweight cromoly-steel hinged chassis, rear-mounted V8 engine,
 front-drive and three-wheels. The vehicle was steered via the third wheel at the rear, capable of 90°
 steering lock. Thus able to steer in a tight circle, the Dymaxion often caused a sensation, bringing
 nearby traffic to a halt.[64][65]<br>

Shortly after launch, a prototype crashed after being hit by another car, killing the Dymaxion's driver.
[66] The other car was driven by a local politician and was illegally removed from the accident scene,
leaving reporters who arrived subsequently to blame the Dymaxion's unconventional design[67] —
though investigations exonerated the prototype.[66] Fuller would himself later crash another prototype
 with his young daughter aboard.<br>

Despite courting the interest of important figures from the auto industry, Fuller used his family
inheritance to finish the second and third prototypes[68] — eventually selling all three, dissolving
Dymaxion Corporation and maintaining the Dymaxion was never intended as a commercial venture.[69]
 One of the three original prototypes survives.[70]<br>

</p>
<h4>Housing</h4>
Fuller's energy-efficient and inexpensive Dymaxion house garnered much interest, but only two prototypes
were ever produced. Here the term "Dymaxion" is used in effect to signify a "radically strong and light
tensegrity structure". One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at the Henry
 Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a
 round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened "bell" of certain jellyfish. It has
 several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces
 water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered
 in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure
  at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling
  and air circulation.<br>

Conceived nearly two decades earlier, and developed in Wichita, Kansas, the house was designed to be
lightweight, adapted to windy climates, cheap to produce and easy to assemble. Because of its light weight
nd portability, the Dymaxion House was intended to be the ideal housing for individuals and families who
wanted the option of easy mobility.[71] The design included a "Go-Ahead-With-Life Room" stocked with maps,
charts, and helpful tools for travel "through time and space".[72] It was to be produced using factories,
workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft. It looked ultramodern at the time, built
of metal, and sheathed in polished aluminum. The basic model enclosed 90 m2 (970 sq ft) of floor area.
Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller
 and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.<br>

In 1967, Fuller developed a concept for an offshore floating city named Triton City and published a
report on the design the following year.[73] Models of the city aroused the interest of President Lyndon
 B. Johnson who, after leaving office, had them placed in the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.[74]<br>

In 1969, Fuller began the Otisco Project, named after its location in Otisco, New York.
The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing
large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, without the use of pouring molds, other
adjacent surfaces or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts
were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a
duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to 60 feet (18 m).
 The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed
  onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to
  be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic
  ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the tubular frame form proved problematic for setting windows
  and doors. It was replaced by an iron rebar set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward
  and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to
  three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones,
   pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.<br>

The project was enabled by a grant underwritten by Syracuse University and sponsored by U.S. Steel
(rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build
large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities
 in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions.<br>
 <h4>Dymaxion map and World Game</h4>
 <p>Fuller, along with co-cartographer Shoji Sadao, also designed an alternative projection map, called the Dymaxion map. This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface.

In the 1960s, Fuller developed the World Game, a collaborative simulation game played on a
70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map,[75] in which players attempt to solve world problems.[76][77] The
object of the simulation game is, in Fuller's words, to "make the world work, for 100% of humanity,
in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the
disadvantage of anyone".[78]</p>
</p>
<h2>Appearance and style</h2>
<p>Buckminster Fuller wore thick-lensed spectacles to correct his extreme hyperopia, a condition that went undiagnosed for the first five years of his life.[79] Fuller's hearing was damaged during his Naval service in World War I and deteriorated during the 1960s.[80] After experimenting with bullhorns as hearing aids during the mid-1960s,[80] Fuller adopted electronic hearing aids from the 1970s onward.[9]:397

In public appearances, Fuller always wore dark-colored suits, appearing like "an alert little clergyman".[81]:18 Previously, he had experimented with unconventional clothing immediately after his 1927 epiphany, but found that breaking social fashion customs made others devalue or dismiss his ideas.[82]:6:15 Fuller learned the importance of physical appearance as part of one's credibility, and decided to become "the invisible man" by dressing in clothes that would not draw attention to himself.[82]:6:15 With self-deprecating humor, Fuller described this black-suited appearance as resembling a "second-rate bank clerk".[82]:6:15

Writer Guy Davenport met him in 1965 and described him thus:</p>
<blockquote >
  He's a dwarf, with a worker's hands, all callouses and squared fingers. He carries an ear trumpet, of green plastic, with WORLD SERIES 1965 printed on it. His smile is golden and frequent; the man's temperament is angelic, and his energy is just a touch more than that of [Robert] Gallway (champeen runner, footballeur, and swimmer). One leg is shorter than the other, and the prescription shoe worn to correct the imbalance comes from a country doctor deep in the wilderness of Maine. Blue blazer, Khrushchev trousers, and a briefcase full of Japanese-made wonderments; ...[83]
</blockquote>
<h2>Quirks</h2>
<p>Following his global prominence from the 1960s onward, Fuller became a frequent flier, often crossing time zones to lecture. In the 1960s and 1970s, he wore three watches simultaneously; one for the time zone of his office at Southern Illinois University, one for the time zone of the location he would next visit, and one for the time zone he was currently in.[81]:290[84][85] In the 1970s, Fuller was only in 'homely' locations (his personal home in Carbondale, Illinois; his holiday retreat in Bear Island, Maine; and his daughter's home in Pacific Palisades, California) roughly 65 nights per year—the other 300 nights were spent in hotel beds in the locations he visited on his lecturing and consulting circuits.[81]:290

In the 1920s, Fuller experimented with polyphasic sleep, which he called Dymaxion sleep. Inspired by the sleep habits of animals such as dogs and cats,[86]:133 Fuller worked until he was tired, and then slept short naps. This generally resulted in Fuller sleeping 30-minute naps every 6 hours.[81]:160 This allowed him "twenty-two thinking hours a day", which aided his work productivity.[81]:160 Fuller reportedly kept this Dymaxion sleep habit for two years, before quitting the routine because it conflicted with his business associates' sleep habits.[87] Despite no longer personally partaking in the habit, in 1943 Fuller suggested Dymaxion sleep as a strategy that the United States could adopt to win World War II.[87]

Despite only practicing true polyphasic sleep for a period during the 1920s, Fuller was known for his stamina throughout his life. He was described as "tireless"[88]:53 by Barry Farrell in Life magazine, who noted that Fuller stayed up all night replying to mail during Farrell's 1970 trip to Bear Island.[88]:55 In his seventies, Fuller generally slept for 5–8 hours per night.[81]:160

Fuller documented his life copiously from 1915 to 1983, approximately 270 feet (82 m) of papers in a collection called the Dymaxion Chronofile. He also kept copies of all incoming and outgoing correspondence. The enormous R. Buckminster Fuller Collection is currently housed at Stanford University.[89]</p>
<blockquote>
  In his youth, Fuller experimented with several ways of presenting himself: R. B. Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such. However, he preferred to be addressed as simply "Bucky".[citation needed]
</blockquote>
<h2>Language and neologisms</h2>
<p>Buckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible.[92] Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.[93]

Fuller used the word Universe without the definite or indefinite articles (the or a) and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that "by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences".[94]

The words "down" and "up", according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words "in" and "out" should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. "I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going "outstairs" and "instairs."' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'"[95]

"World-around" is a term coined by Fuller to replace "worldwide". The general belief in a flat Earth died out in classical antiquity, so using "wide" is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth—a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms "sunsight" and "sunclipse", replacing "sunrise" and "sunset" to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre-Copernican celestial mechanics.

Fuller also invented the word "livingry," as opposed to weaponry (or "killingry"), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. "The architectural profession—civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical—has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry."[96]

As well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term "tensegrity", a portmanteau of "tensional integrity". "Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder."[97]

"Dymaxion" is a portmanteau of "dynamic maximum tension". It was invented around 1929 by two admen at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design – dynamic, maximum, and tension.[98]

Fuller also helped to popularize the concept of Spaceship Earth: "The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it."[99]</p>

<h2>Influence and legacy</h2>
<p>Among the many people who were influenced by Buckminster Fuller are: Constance Abernathy,[105] Ruth Asawa,[106] J. Baldwin,[107][108] Michael Ben-Eli,[109] Pierre Cabrol,[110] John Cage, Joseph Clinton,[111] Peter Floyd,[109] Norman Foster,[112] [113] Medard Gabel,[114] Michael Hays,[109] Ted Nelson,[115] David Johnston,[116] Peter Jon Pearce,[109] Shoji Sadao,[109] Edwin Schlossberg,[109] Kenneth Snelson,[106][117][118] Robert Anton Wilson[119] and Stewart Brand.[120]

An allotrope of carbon, fullerene—and a particular molecule of that allotrope C60 (buckminsterfullerene or buckyball) has been named after him. The Buckminsterfullerene molecule, which consists of 60 carbon atoms, very closely resembles a spherical version of Fuller's geodesic dome. The 1996 Nobel prize in chemistry was given to Kroto, Curl, and Smalley for their discovery of the fullerene.[121]

He is quoted in the lyric of "The Tower of Babble" in the[when?] musical Godspell: "Man is a complex of patterns and processes."[122]

The indie band Driftless Pony Club named their 2011 album, Buckminster,[123] after him. All the songs within the album are based upon his life and works.

On July 12, 2004, the United States Post Office released a new commemorative stamp honoring R. Buckminster Fuller on the 50th anniversary of his patent for the geodesic dome and by the occasion of his 109th birthday. The stamp's design replicated the January 10, 1964 cover of Time Magazine.

Fuller was the subject of two documentary films: The World of Buckminster Fuller (1971) and Buckminster Fuller: Thinking Out Loud (1996). Additionally, filmmaker Sam Green and the band Yo La Tengo collaborated on a 2012 "live documentary" about Fuller, The Love Song of R. Buckminster Fuller.[124]

In June 2008, the Whitney Museum of American Art presented "Buckminster Fuller: Starting with the Universe", the most comprehensive retrospective to date of his work and ideas.[125] The exhibition traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago in 2009. It presented a combination of models, sketches, and other artifacts, representing six decades of the artist's integrated approach to housing, transportation, communication, and cartography. It also featured the extensive connections with Chicago from his years spent living, teaching, and working in the city.[126]

In 2009, a number of US companies decided to repackage spherical magnets and sell them as toys. One company, Maxfield & Oberton, told The New York Times that they saw the product on YouTube and decided to repackage them as "Buckyballs", because the magnets could self-form and hold together in shapes reminiscent of the Fuller inspired buckyballs.[127] The buckyball toy launched at New York International Gift Fair in 2009 and sold in the hundreds of thousands, but by 2010 began to experience problems with toy safety issues and the company was forced to recall the packages that were labelled as toys.[128]

Robert Kiyosaki's 2015 book Second Chance[129] is largely about Kiyosaki's interactions with Fuller, and Fuller's unusual final book Grunch of Giants.[130]

In 2012, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art hosted "The Utopian Impulse" – a show about Buckminster Fuller's influence in the Bay Area. Featured were concepts, inventions and designs for creating "free energy" from natural forces, and for sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. The show ran January through July.[131]

Fuller is briefly mentioned in the 2014 superhero film, X-Men: Days of Future Past, when Kitty Pryde is giving a lecture to a group of students regarding utopian architecture.[132]

In a different note, Fuller's quote "Those who play with the Devil's toys, will be brought by degree to wield his sword" was used and referenced as the first display seen in the strategy sci-fi video game XCOM: Enemy Within developed by Firaxis Games.

The House of Tomorrow, is a 2017 American independent drama film written and directed by Peter Livolsi, based on Peter Bognanni's 2010 novel of the same name, featuring Asa Butterfield, Alex Wolff, Nick Offerman, Maude Apatow, and Ellen Burstyn. Burstyn's character is obsessed by all things Buckminster Fuller providing retro-futurist tours of her geodesic home, including authentic video of Buckminster Fuller talking and sailing with Ellen Burstyn, who'd actually befriended him in real life.

However, in 1927 his own financial difficulties forced Mr. Hewlett to sell his stock in the company. Within weeks Stockade Building Systems became a subsidiary of Celotex Corporation, whose primary motivation was akin to that of other conventional companies: making a profit. Celotex management took one look at Stockade's financial records and called for a complete overhaul of the company. The first casualty of the transition was Stockade's controversial president [Buckminster Fuller, who was fired].

With no steady income the Fuller family was living beyond its means and falling further and further into debt. Searching for solace and escape, Bucky continued drinking and carousing. He also tended to wander aimlessly through the Chicago streets pondering his situation. It was during one such walk that he ventured down to the shore of Lake Michigan on a particularly cold autumn evening and seriously contemplated swimming out until he was exhausted and ending his life.

Now his exposure to Modernism and "the American century" received a decidedly New York influence.
"Only two years before, on the brink of suicide, Fuller had decided to remake his life and the world. Why not begin on Minetta Street? In 1929, he was shopping around his first major design, plans for an inexpensive, modular home that others air-lift right where desired. Now, in exchange for meals, he took on the interior decoration and chairs for Marie's new location. He must have stood out in person, too, ever the talkative, handsome visionary in tie and starched collar."

Fuller had built three models that drew enthusiastic crowds wherever. Like all Fuller's other projects (he was responsible for refining and developing the geodesic dome, the first practical dome structure) it was inexpensive, durable and energy efficient; Fuller worked diligently to cut back the amount of material and energy used by any product he designed. "You've produced exactly the car I've always wanted to produce," the mechanically apt Chrysler told him. Then Chrysler noted ruefully, Fuller had taken one-third the time and one fourth the money Chrysler's corporation usually spent producing prototypes — prototypes Chrysler himself usually hated in the end. For a few months, it had seemed Chrysler would go ahead and introduce Fuller's car. But the banks that financed Chrysler's wholesale distributors vetoed the move by threatening to call in their loans. The bankers were afraid (or so Fuller said years later) that an advanced new design would diminish the value of the unsold motor vehicles in dealers' showrooms. For every new car sold, five used cars had to be sold to finance the distribution and production chain, and those cars would not sell if Fuller's invention made them obsolete.
