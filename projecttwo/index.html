<div id="p1"> <p>I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, <br>but I understand that in the
   Gothic cathedral of the West,<br> the roof is thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle <br> as high in the
   heavens as possible- <br>and that herein is thought to lie its special beauty. <br>In the temples of Japan, on
   the other hand, <br>a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, <br>spacious shadows created by
   the eaves the rest of the structure is built. <br>Nor is this true only of temples; in the palaces of the
   nobility <br> and the houses of the common people, what first strikes the eye <br>is the massive roof of tile or
    thatch and the heavy darkness <br>that hangs beneath the eaves. Even at midday cavernous darkness spreads <br>
     over all beneath the roof's edge, <br>making entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but invisible.<br>
     The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the farmhouses of the <br> remote countryside are
     alike in this respect: <br>like most buildings of the past their roofs give the impression <br> of possessing
     far greater weight, height, and surface <br>than all that stands beneath the eaves.

</p></div>

<p><div id="p2">There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun <br>
  than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create <br>
  as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible. <br>If the roof of a
  Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap, <br>with as small a visor as
  possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves. <br>There are no doubt all sorts
   of reasons- climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. <br>The fact that we did not use glass,
    concrete, and bricks, for instance, <br>made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain.
    A light room would <br>no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room.
    The quality that we call beauty, <br>however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our
    ancestors,  <br>forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty in shadows, <br>ultimately to
    guide shadows towards beauty's ends.</div></p>

  <p><div id="p3"> And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation <br>
    of shadows, heavy shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the <br>
    simplicity of Japanese rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament.<br>
     Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. <br>
     Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the <br>
     eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden <br>
     steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes <br>
      for us the charm of a room. We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays <br>
      can sink into absolute repose. The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, <br>
      but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. <br>
      A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light. <br>
       We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays clinging to the surface of a <br>
       dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, <br>
       for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. And so, as we must <br>
       if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. <br>
       The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; <br>
       not so much a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the <br>
       mood of the viewer. And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows <br>
       in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own. <br>
