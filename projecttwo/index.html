<div id="text">
<div id="p1"> <p><div id="start">I possess no </div>specialized knowledge of architecture, <br>but I understand that in the
   Gothic cathedral of the West,<br> the roof is thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle <br> as high in the
   heavens as possible- <br>and that herein is thought to lie its special beauty. <br>In the temples of Japan, on
   the other hand, <br>a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, <br>spacious shadows created by
   the eaves the rest of the structure is built. <br>Nor is this true only of temples; in the palaces of the
   nobility <br> and the houses of the common people, what first strikes the eye <br>is the massive roof of tile or
    thatch and the heavy darkness <br>that hangs beneath the eaves. Even at midday cavernous darkness spreads <br>
     over all beneath the roof's edge, <br>making entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but invisible.<br>
     The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the farmhouses of the <br> remote countryside are
     alike in this respect: <br>like most buildings of the past their roofs give the impression <br> of possessing
     far greater weight, height, and surface <br>than all that stands beneath the eaves.

</p></div>

<p><div id="p2"><div id="start">There are of</div> course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun <br>
  than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create <br>
  as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible. <br>If the roof of a
  Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap, <br>with as small a visor as
  possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves. <br>There are no doubt all sorts
   of reasons- climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. <br>The fact that we did not use glass,
    concrete, and bricks, for instance, <br>made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain.
    A light room would <br>no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room.
    The quality that we call beauty, <br>however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our
    ancestors,  <br>forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty in shadows, <br>ultimately to
    guide shadows towards beauty's ends.</div></p>

  <p><div id="p3"><div id="start"> And so it </div>has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation <br>
    of shadows, heavy shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the <br>
    simplicity of Japanese rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament.<br>
     Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. <br>
     Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the <br>
     eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden <br>
     steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes <br>
      for us the charm of a room. We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays <br>
      can sink into absolute repose. The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, <br>
      but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. <br>
      A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light. <br>
       We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays clinging to the surface of a <br>
       dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, <br>
       for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. And so, as we must <br>
       if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. <br>
       The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; <br>
       not so much a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the <br>
       mood of the viewer. And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows <br>
       in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own. <br>

</div></p>

<p><div id="p4">
<div id="start">Of course the </div>Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it <br>a hanging scroll and a flower
arrangement. <br>But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather <br>to give depth to the
shadows. We value a scroll <br>above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, <br>and thus we
consider the mounting quite <br>as important as the calligraphy or painting. Even the greatest <br>masterpiece
will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails <br>to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular
 distinction may <br>blend beautifully with the room and set off to unexpected advantage both <br>itself and
 its surroundings. Wherein lies the power of an <br>otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect?<br>
 Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the mounting will possess <br>a certain look of antiquity,
  and this look of antiquity <br> will strike just the right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room.
</div></p>

<p><div id="p5"><div id="start">We have all </div>had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples <br> of Kyoto or Nara,
  of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, <br>hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove.
   So dark are these alcoves, <br> even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines <br>of the work;
    all we can do is listen to the explanation of <br>the guide, follow as best we can the all-but
     invisible <br> brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be. <br>Yet the
     combination of that blurred old painting <br>and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony.
     The lack of clarity, <br>far from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly.
<br>
For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface <br>upon which the faint,
frail light can play; it performs precisely <br>the same function as the sand-textured wall.
 This is why <br>we attach such importance to age and patina. A new painting, <br>even one done in ink
 monochrome or subtle pastels, <br>can quite destroy the shadows of an alcove, <br> unless it is selected
 with the greatest care.</div>
</p>

<p><div id="p6">
<div id="start">A Japanese room </div>might be likened to an inkwash painting, the paper-paneled shoji being the expanse <br>
 where the ink is thinnest, and the alcove where it is darkest.<br> Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully
 built Japanese room, <br> I marvel at our comprehension of the secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of shadow
 and light.<br> For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device. <br>An empty space is marked
  off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows <br>within emptiness.
  There is nothing more. <br>And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam,<br>
   around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, <br>though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow,<br>
   we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete
    and <br>utter silence; that here in the darkness immutable tranquility holds sway.<br> The "mysterious Orient"
    of which Westerners speak probably refers to the <br>uncanny silence of these dark places.<br>
    And even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we <br>peered into the depths of an alcove
     to which the sunlight had never penetrated. <br>Where lies the key to this mystery? <br>illtimately it is
     the magic of shadows.<br> Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, <br>the alcove would in that
      instant revert to mere void.</div>
</p>

<p><div id="p7">
<div id="start">This was the </div>genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light <br>from this empty space they
imparted to the world of shadows <br>that formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior <br>to that
of any wall painting or ornament. The technique seems simple,<br> but was by no means so simply achieved.<br>
 We can imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were taken <br>with each invisible detail-<br>the
 placement of the window in the shelving recess,<br> the depth of the crossbeam, the height of the threshold.<br>
  But for me the most exquisite touch is-the pale white glow of the shoji in the study bay;<br>
   I need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time.<br>

The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting window <br> built to provide a place
 for reading. <br>Over the years it came to be regarded as no more than a source of light <br>for the alcove;
 but most often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove <br> as to soften the sidelong rays from without,<br>
  to filter them through paper panels. <br>There is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time <br>it
  reaches these panels. The little sunlight from the garden that manages <br>to make its way beneath the
   eaves and through the corridors <br>has by then lost its power to illuminate, seems drained of the
   complexion of life. <br>It can do no more than accentuate the whiteness of the paper. <br>I sometimes linger
    before these panels and study the surface of the paper, <br>ight, but giving no impression of brilliance.
  </div>
</p>

<p><div id="p8"> <div id="start">In temple architecture </div>the main room stands at a considerable distance from the garden;<br>
  so dilute is the light there that no matter what the season,<br> on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday,
   or evening,<br> the pale, white glow scarcely varies. <br>And the shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem
   strangely immobile, as if dust collected <br>in the corners had become a part of the paper itself.<br>
    I blink in uncertainty at this dreamlike luminescence, feeling as though some misty film were blunting
     my vision.<br> The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove,<br>
      is instead repelled by the darkness, creating a world of confusion where dark and light are
      indistinguishable. <br>Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the light that suffuses such a
      room, a rare tranquility not found in <br>ordinary light? Have you never felt a sort of fear in the
      face of the ageless,<br> a fear that in that room you might lose all consciousness <br>of the passage of
       time, that untold years might pass and <br>upon emerging you should find you had grown old and gray?
</div></p>

<p><div id="p9"> <div id="start">And surely you </div>have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of these huge <br>
  buildings, to which sunlight never penetrates, how the gold leaf of a sliding door <br>or screen will
  pick up a distant glimmer from the garden,<br> then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow, a faint golden
  light cast into the enveloping darkness, <br>like the glow upon the horizon at sunset. <br>In no other setting
  is gold quite so exquisitely beautiful. <br>You walk past, turning to look again, and yet again; and as
   you move away the golden surface <br>of the paper glows ever more deeply, changing not in a flash, <br>but
   growing slowly, steadily brighter, like color rising in the face of a giant.<br> Or again you may find
   that the gold dust of the background, <br>which until that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will,<br>
    as you move past, suddenly gleam forth as if it had burst into flame.
</div></p>

<p><div id="p10"><div id="start">How, in such </div>a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me.<br>
  But I see why in ancient times statues of the Buddha were gilt <br> with gold and why gold leaf covered
  the walls of the homes of the nobility.<br> Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty
  of gold; <br>but those who lived in the dark houses of the past were not merely captivated by its beauty,<br>
   they also knew its practical value; for gold, in these dim rooms,<br> must have served the function of
    a reflector. <br>Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was not mere extravagance. <br>Its reflective properties
    were put to use as a source of illumination.<br> Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss,<br>
    but gold retains its brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of the room. <br>This is why gold
     was held in such incredibly high esteem.
